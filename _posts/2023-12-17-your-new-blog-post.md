## Market/Competitors Analysis:
```
As noted below, there are few direct competitors for our envisioned application. FairTrip, offers unique community and socially driven features designed around eco-tourism, whereas Ecobnb focuses solely on booking vetted eco-friendly accommodations. While both applications offer something unique, they do not have features that can track estimated user carbon emissions, provide both eco-friendly activities and accommodation suggestions or offer tips to reduce carbon emissions while traveling.  
FairTrip
A sustainable travel guide that focuses on discovering impactful areas and promoting responsible tourism.
Strengths: 
Community-Driven Content
Relies on user contributions to build its database of sustainable places
Focus on Social Impact
Highlights locations with a positive social impact to support eco-friendly communities.
Limitations: 
Their focus is heavily on social impact and may lack information on carbon footprint or eco-friendly practices
Ecobnb
A sustainable travel marketplace for booking eco-friendly accommodations.
Strengths: 
Diverse Sustainable Accommodations
Lists various types of eco-friendly accommodations. (ex. Tree houses, ice igloos, and organic houses)
Detailed Sustainability Criteria

## Approach:
```
Our approach to creating new user value revolves around integrating comprehensive eco-friendly features that go beyond the capabilities of existing competitors. 
Unlike FairTrip, which emphasizes community and social aspects, and Ecobnb, which concentrates on eco-friendly accommodations, our app distinguishes itself by offering a multifaceted approach. 
Our platform will stand out as a one-stop solution that seamlessly integrates travel planning such as accommodation booking, activity planning, and carbon footprint management while connecting with other users to receive or give suggestions on other eco-friendly destinations and activities.

## User study plan:
```
Formative study
The main objective of our formative study is to understand the target userâ€™s level of awareness regarding eco-friendly travel apps, their travel habits, and interest in our app, and identify specific features via heuristic evaluation that have been noted by the user group.
Example Qualitative Interview Questions:
Travel Habits
How frequently do you travel for leisure in a year?
What types of travel activities do you typically engage in?
How do you usually plan your trips?
Eco-Friendly Travel Awareness
How familiar are you with the concept of eco-friendly travel?
Eco-Friendly Travel App Features
If there was an eco-friendly travel app, what features would you find most useful? 





Summative study
The main objective of our summative survey is to use both quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the adoption rate of our application, the perceived benefits from the user, and overall user satisfaction with different iterations of the system.
Quantitative Evaluations:
Evaluation: A/B Testing different iterations of our system and features:
Group 1: System version A
Group 2: System version B
Method: Independent Sample T-testing

Qualitative:
 Example Interview Questions:
Match Between System and the Real World
To what extent do the eco-friendly travel options presented in the app align with your real-world expectations?
User Control and Freedom
How easy is it for you to navigate back or undo an action if needed?
Consistency and Standards
How consistent is the app's design and layout throughout different sections?
How efficient is the app for experienced users, allowing them to perform tasks quickly?
Compare and Contrast
How does the app compare to how it was 3 months ago, were there any improvements or downgrades?

Implications of the Project
Environmental Impact: Our app aims to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of travel, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change. By influencing individual travel behaviors, we contribute to a larger movement towards sustainability.
Market Influence: By focusing on eco-friendly travel, our app could set new standards in the tourism industry, encouraging more businesses to adopt sustainable practices. This could lead to a broader shift towards eco-conscious travel across the industry.
Educational Outreach: The app's educational aspect has the potential to raise awareness about sustainable travel practices, reaching beyond just the users to their communities, and potentially inspiring a wider audience to adopt eco-friendly habits.
Community Building: Facilitating connections among like-minded travelers can foster a supportive community, creating a network of eco-conscious individuals who share tips, experiences, and best practices.


Limitations of the Project
User Base Limitation: The app targets a niche market of eco-conscious travelers. While this focus is a strength, it also limits the user base, potentially excluding those who are less informed or interested in sustainability.
Accuracy of Carbon Calculations: Calculating the carbon footprint of travel involves complexities and variables that might affect the accuracy of the app's metrics. Keeping these calculations up-to-date and accurate is challenging.
Behavioral Change Resistance: Changing travel habits can be difficult for users, especially when it involves compromising convenience or familiarity. Encouraging sustained behavioral change is a significant challenge.
Data Privacy Concerns: With real-time tracking and personalized suggestions, handling user data sensitively and securely is crucial. Users may have concerns about how their data is used and stored.
Dependence on External Factors: The effectiveness of the app depends on external factors such as the availability of sustainable travel options and local infrastructure, which may vary greatly by region.
```

## Final Remarks:
```
Our eco-friendly travel app stands as a promising tool in the movement towards sustainable tourism. Its focus on reducing environmental impact, coupled with its educational and community-building features, positions it well to make a positive difference. However, it is important to address its limitations, such as the niche target audience, complexities in carbon footprint calculations, and potential resistance to behavioral change.


Continuously evolving the app based on user feedback, staying informed of the latest in sustainable travel practices, and ensuring data privacy and security will be key to its long-term success and impact. In essence, our app is not just a tool for travel planning but a potential catalyst for change in the travel industry, promoting a more sustainable and responsible way to explore the world.
